## About ##

Hi, I'm Viji, a Data Science Enthusiast. I hold an M-Tech degree in Computer Controlled Industrial Power from NIT Calicut.
After spending 8 years of working life in academia and research, I took a career break due to some personal circumstances. I was always
passionate about data and utilized this time in honing my analytical and programming skills by taking up certifications in data science.

This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
