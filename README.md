## About ##

Hi, I'm Viji, a Data Science Enthusiast. I hold an M-Tech degree in Computer Controlled Industrial Power from NIT Calicut.
After spending 8 years of working life in academia and research, I took a career break due to some personal circumstances. I was always
passionate about data and utilized this time in honing my analytical and programming skills by taking up certifications in data science.

This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects ##
**Book Recommendation using Collaborative filtering** -The objective of this project is to give personalized book recommendations using GoodReads. For this, users with similar tastes in books are identified first using their previous reviews. And the personalized recommendations (predictions) are based on what these users have liked. The GoodReads Book data scraped by UCSD Research Engineers available at https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph is used.

**House Price prediction using Regression model** - A model to predict the value of a given house in King county using various regression models. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning. Three regression models - multiple linear regression, Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression models were compared to find the best fitting model. The dataset https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction is taken from Kaggle and contains house sale prices for King County for houses sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

**HR analytics dashboard using PowerBI:** - HR dataset is analyzed to uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition in a fictional company. Power Query Editor is used to investigate and clean the data to find out attrition rates among different age groups. Used DAX to understand the percent attrition. Finally, all the findings were used to create a business dashboard to answer questions for the HR department.(https://github.com/vijivenugopal/HR_analytics_dashboard_PowerBI.git)



## Study Projects ##
**European Soccer Regression analysis using Scikit-learn** - The objective of this project is to predict the overall rating of each player using Decision Tree Regressor model. This project uses the open dataset from Kaggle . This European Soccer Database has more than 25,000 matches and more than 10,000 players for European professional soccer seasons from 2008 to 2016.

**Natural Language Processing of Movie Reviews using nltk** - In the movie_reviews dataset, there are 2000 text files, each of them is a review of a movie, and they are already split in a neg folder for the negative reviews and a pos folder for the positive reviews. Each review is tokenized to split the text into words. Then a bag-of-words model is built to infer the sentiment in each text .From the bag-of-words model we can build features to be used by a classifier to separate the negative and positive features. The classifier used is the Naive Bayes Classifier.
